# Totem Expansion

This is a fabric port of the original Totem Expansion by Lemonszz. Totem Expansion adds a variety of new totems and mechanics to the game.

### General
This mod now allows the totem of undying (and all new totems) to work in any slot. All totems are also craftable, consisting of a totem base and a totem head of their respective type. Totem bases can be crafted with 4 clay and a stick. Totem heads are dropped occasionally by mobs or can be purchased from the new villager, the Witch Doctor. The Witch Doctor's profession block is a wither skeleton skull, so he will not spawn naturally. Additionally, holding shift while levitating will now cause the player to slowly descend.

### New Totems
- Totem of Ascending - saves the player from a deadly fall
- Totem of Smoldering - saves the player from lava or fire
- Totem of Breathing - saves the player from the drowning
- Totem of Defusing - defuses explosions
- Totem of Repairing - repairs an item if it breaks
- Totem of Spelunking - reveals ore around the player in a 30 block radius
- Totem of Advancing - advances time by 10 hours
- Totem of Recalling - sends the player back to their spawn
